# Final Project Proposal: CodingBridge

## Project Title: CodingBridge

CodingBridge is an experimental non-profit programming tutorial platform that helps adult beginners with no programming experience to learn with less anxiety, more confidence. The goal here is to design curriculums for people who are not good at math, science or computation in conventional education system.

## Problem: lack of tutorial platform designed for right-brained creatives

The rapid development of computational technology is pushing more designers, artists and creative workers to learn programming in recent years. For creatives who owns both logical and artistic brain powers, learning to code is not a big issue. But for right-brained talents without confidence on left-brain performance, the process of learning programming would cause lots of pain. 

## Address Greater Landscape

Though most existing online programming tutorial platforms are teaching excellent lectures, few of which are fully friendly for creative talents. CodingBridge is here as a supplementary resource to help beginners understand concepts from right-brain perspective, and not a replacement of existing tutorial platforms.

## Deliverables

Basic ICM Supplementary Resource

## Implementation

Because this is a tutorial website that focuses on providing best experience for beginners, at least half of the resource will be invested on design of interface, experience and curriculum.

Except from the design tasks, the site will be built by Node.js and JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Timeline (WIP)

The ambitious goal is to complete [1.0: Basic ICM Supplementary Resource](https://github.com/vince19972/CodingBridge/wiki/1.0:-Basic-ICM-Supplementary-Resource) requirements.

### Week 1

- 0.2: Curriculum Design

### Week 2

- 0.4: UI Design

### Week 3

- 0.6: Minimal Viable Prototype

### Week 4

- 0.8: Beta Version

### Week 5

- 1.0: Project Release

## Accessibility

Because most part of the tutorials will be designed for visual learner by using interactive animation or images, it might require extra efforts to make it accessbile to visually impaired learners.

## Mentoring

Because I barely have no experience in full-stack development, I might need helps on building the site at some point of the progress. Designing the curriculum is challenging, and it's not going to be good enough with my own perspective. I'll need feedbacks and advices to make it better.

Possible Mentor:
- [Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) : Taeyoon is the co-founder of SFPC, which has lots of experience of teaching artits programming from the perspective of artists.

## About me

I'm a self-taught front-end developer and graphic designer. In my journey of [transitioning from designer to developer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/graphic-designer-to-front-end-developer-7be7bfd6a46c), high level of confusion and anxiety was along the way. I couldn't make it without the selfless help from internet, including countless open-source projects.
The idea of building this project is coming from nothing else but that experience of transition. It'd be an honor to help more creatives to learn programming with less anxiety, more condidence. And it's an honor to contribute to the community that helped me so much.
